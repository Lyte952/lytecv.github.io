            <li>Lyte foundation website: Lyte foundation is a charity foundation.
                <br> Lyte foundation website is my first project in web development and was built with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
                <br>
                HTML was used for the DOM, CSS was used for design and responsiveness
                and Javascript was used for functionality.
                <br> Visit Lyte Foundation website at <a href='https://Lyte952.github.io'><button>Lyte website</button></a>

                My Portfolio Website: This website, as it is here, was built with HTML, CSS and Javascript
            </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Apps</h2>
            Horoscope app: This horoscope app prints out your daily horoscope message using an API from a horoscope website.
            <br> I built this app with Python as its backend and functionality program and Django as its framework.

        <h2>GitHub</h2>
        I have Git and GitHub experience close to about a biennial.
        <br> I am currently working on my eleventh project and hope to complete it by the end of this month.
        <br> I use Visual Studio Code integrated with GitHub for all my projects.
        <br> Therefore, I deploy all my websites for free with GitHub pages.
        <br> Here is a link to my GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/Lyte952"><button>Lyte952</button></a>
        <br>
        <h2>CodePen</h2>
        CodePen is an open source website which has HTML, CSS and javaScript IDEs embedded.
        <br> I use these CodePen to create sample templates and designs and test to see how my 
        <br> DOM looks like when I add certain features, manipulations and responsiveness to my website.
        <br> I learn new styles and designs from other professional designers on codepen.
        <br> Here's a link to my codepen account <a href="https://codepen.io/Lyte952"><button>Lyte's CodePen</button></a>

    <div class="pagedesc">
        As a technical writer in Tech, I have contributed to the tech community with a book at a rather fair price.
        <br> 
        <ul><li>Easy GitHub is a technical book which focuses on how to use GitHub and effectively control your app versions.</li>
        <br> <li>I made sure to include important info which enables starters to use GitHub.</li>
        <br> <li>The simplified and straight-to-the-point writing character in the book makes it possible for consistent readers to understand and finish the book in less than two weeks.</li>
        </ul>
        Watch out for 'Peacock', my next book on Tailwind CSS.

                <br>  ∙I reviewed the National Health Insurance Scheme(NHIS) cards and NHIS drug prescriptions, and also helped in costing the drug prices and drug code writing.

                <br> ∙I used an e-commerce app called Intellitrade to keep track of all drug sales and total sales made in a day, month and the corresponding year.
                <br> ∙I also used the app to print out out-of-stock and expired drugs for trade efficiency and prevent fines for mistakenly giving out expired drugs.
