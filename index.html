            ∙ Lyte foundation website: Lyte foundation is a charity foundation.
                <br> Lyte foundation website is my first project in web development and was built with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
                <br>
                HTML was used for the DOM, CSS was used for design and responsiveness
                and Javascript was used for functionality.

            <h2>Apps</h2>
            Horoscope app: This horoscope app prints out your daily horoscope message using an API from a horoscope website.

        <h2>GitHub</h2>
        I have Git and GitHub experience close to about a biennial.
        I am currently working on my eleventh project and hope to complete it by the end of this month.
        I use Visual Studio Code integrated with GitHub for all my projects.
        Therefore, I deploy all my websites for free with GitHub pages.
        <br> Here is a link to my GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/Lyte952"><button>Lyte952</button></a>
        <br>
        <h2>CodePen</h2>
        CodePen is an open source website which has HTML, CSS and javaScript IDEs embedded.
        I use these CodePen to create sample templates and designs and test to see how my 
        DOM looks like when I add certain features, manipulations and responsiveness to my website.
        I learn new styles and designs from other professional designers on codepen.

    <h1 class="buttadv">Book</h1>
    <div class="pagedesc">
        As a technical writer in Tech, I have contributed to the tech community with a book at a rather fair price.
        <br> 
        <br> ∙ Easy GitHub is a technical book which focuses on how to use GitHub and effectively control your app versions.
        <br> ∙ I made sure to include important info which enables starters to use GitHub.
        <br> ∙ The simplified and straight-to-the-point writing character in the book makes it possible for consistent readers to understand and finish the book in less than two weeks.
        Watch out for 'Peacock', my next book on Tailwind CSS.

            <br> ∙ 2016-2018, Greenlight Pharmacy
                <br> ∙ I reviewed the National Health Insurance Scheme(NHIS) cards and NHIS drug prescriptions, and also helped in costing the drug prices and drug code writing.
                <br>
                <br> ∙ Key achievement: Managed to increase the NHIS drug cost payment by 16 percent by reviewing and correcting mistakes in drug code writing.
            <br>
            <br>
            ∙ 2021-Now, Joe Bennett Pharmacy
                <br> ∙ I used an e-commerce app called Intellitrade to keep track of all drug sales and total sales made in a day, month and the corresponding year.
                <br> ∙ I also used the app to print out out-of-stock and expired drugs for trade efficiency and prevent fines for mistakenly giving out expired drugs.
